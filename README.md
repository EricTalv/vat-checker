### MVP TO:DO 

I usually start my work by setting up 
a simple MVP TO-DO List.

Later I might add stretch goals. 

[ ] Setup Environment
[ ] Simple Front-End
[ ] Send succesful request to Endpoint
 [ ] Return Data 
 [ ] Validate Data
[ ] Front-end additions
 [ ] Country drop-down component
 




## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
